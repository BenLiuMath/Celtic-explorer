# Celtic-explorer

Celtic Explorer is a graphical user interface for rendering and manipulating Celtic knots on a rectangular grid. The application is web based and built on the HTML5 Canvas element and JavaScript.

## More
I became interested in Celtic knots after seeing a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O_0yegDdIw) outlining the basic process for drawing them.

After drawing several knots, I wanted to get a computer to do the work of drawing for me, so that I could concentrate on understanding their structure. It took several years, and the popularization of the HTML5 Canvas element, but I finally figured how to programmatically draw Celtic knots in a web-based application.

Although the procedure for drawing Celtic knots is relatively simple, it's much harder to represent and formalize the algorithm. I first had to develop a formalism for represent Celtic knots, and then another to render them from this representation.
